# Development-of-Email-Spam-Ham-Identifier (NLP)
Development of Email Spam Identifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Tools: Python

Developed a spam filter classifier to detect whether a given email is spam or ham based on the mail content

The dataset was imported from the repository of Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the University of California, Irvine. The dataset is called the 'SMS Spam Collection', which is a public set of labeled SMS messages that have been collected for spam research. It has 5,574 English, real and non-encoded messages, tagged by humans to be legitimate (ham) or spam.

Steps:

1. Performed preprocessing including word stemming and tokenization, and made a vocabulary list based on word frequency 
2. Converted each mail into a feature vector using Vectorization and achieved an accuracy of around 96% using Na√Øve Base classifier
